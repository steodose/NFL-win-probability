Choose a game from the 2022 season to see its play-by-play win probability chart. For example, selecting "2022_01_BUF_LA" will show you win probability for the 2022 Week 1 matchup between the Buffalo Bills and Los Angeles Rams.

### About

**NFL Win Probability Tool**

This dashboard looks at individual game win probability. It uses play-by-play data from Ben Baldwin and Sebastian Carlâ€™s nflfastR package.  nflfastR is an extension of the original work done by the nflscrapR team (Maksim Horowitz, Ron Yurko, and Sam Ventura). App created by [Stephan Teodosescu](https://stephanteodosescu.com/).


More on these metrics and the models underpinning them can be found at [Open Source Football](https://www.opensourcefootball.com/posts/2020-09-28-nflfastr-ep-wp-and-cp-models/).


This dashboard is built with R using the [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) frameworks. The code behind the dashboard is made available [here](https://github.com/steodose/NFL-win-probability)
